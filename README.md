# Potato-Tapping-Game
I Just Made A Chrome Extension For Fun And Its... Okay I Guess
To Add To Chrome Follow Steps
#1: download
#2: extract all
#2.5: open file explorer, open the downloads page, open the file thats called "Potato-Tapping-Game-main"(unzipped version) open the folder with the same name inside, after that you see readme.md and extension.zip, select extension.zip then grab the file just called extension inside of that (not zipped) and drag it to download (copy it to downloads)
#3: go to chrome://extensions/
#4: turn on developer mode
#5: select "Load unpacked" in the top left
#6: find the extracted extension and select
#7: if it all worked then yay if not feel free to ask me or i guess find a tutorial
